- **Working with data with `pandas`**: Pandas's own deceptively titled [10 minutes to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html#) provides a nice overview of the _many_ things it can do, with links to more comprehensive documentation. As you're working on your project, you may also appreciate having the [Pandas cheat sheet](http://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) handy.

- **Geospatial analysis with `geopandas`**: A great overview of geospatial analysis in Python is this free course on [Automating Geospatial Analyses in Python](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/). A lot of the material in here intersects with stuff we covered in class (in fact, last week's Shapely lesson was basically lifted from their [lesson on geometries](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/notebooks/L1/geometric-objects.html)). If you are interested in doing real GIS with GeoPandas for your final project, I would consult the following lessons:
    - [Map Projections](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/notebooks/L2/projections.html)
    - [Calculating distances](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/notebooks/L2/calculating-distances.html)
    - [Nearest Neighbor Analysis](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/notebooks/L3/nearest-neighbour.html)
    - [Geometric operations](https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/site/notebooks/L4/geometric-operations.html)

- **Plotting data with `matplotlib.pyplot`**: Probably the best place to start is `matplotlib`'s own [set of tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/tutorials/index.html). The plotting capabilities of Python are extensive and, in some cases, have complex and counterintuitive interfaces, and it will take you a long time to master them. My advice would be to find plots (here and elsewhere) that look like what you want to accomplish with your own data and use their code as a template.
